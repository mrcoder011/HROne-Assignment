Create a sample backend application for a JSON Schema Builder using ReactJS and preferably  ShadCN, optionally incorporating TypeScript if possible. This task assumes a basic understanding of JavaScript, along with some knowledge of ReactJS and AntD/ShadCN. The objective is to develop a Schema Building experience, as demonstrated in the provided video, utilising React-Hook Forms for the implementation.
Task Description
Build a component that allows users to create an interface to define a JSON schema by adding fields dynamically. Users should be able to edit the name/key of a field, add more fields, delete a field, and add nested fields for the 'Nested' type. The supported types are String, Number, and Nested, with the ability to have recursive nested rows.
Key Tasks:
Develop a component with the following functionalities:
Edit the name/key of a field
Add more fields dynamically
Delete a field
Add nested fields for the 'Nested' type (recursively)
Include a JSON tab that displays the real-time JSON preview of the components. Assume default values for String and Number type rows, as demonstrated in the provided Image
